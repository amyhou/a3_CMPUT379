# CMPUT 379 Assignment 3: Trivial Unix File System - README

## Introduction

## Acknowledgements

## Implementation

## Testing
Ran the provided consistency checks to validate the fs_mount function

Ran the sample tests 1-4 provided on eClass, and compared stdout and stderr to the result files given. Also ran a binary compare between the resultant disk file provided and the disk file that was manipulated. No differences were detected.

Ran with valgrind - still accessible blocks but those are due to using STL containers
